1. Define the Business Problem
Actions:

Meet with stakeholders to understand the business objective (e.g., improve player retention, increase in-game spending).

Establish clear, measurable goals and KPIs (e.g., DAU, ARPU).

Align the problem with organizational priorities to ensure relevance.

2. Data Collection & Integration
Actions:

Identify and gather data from all relevant sources (game logs, player transactions, user profiles).

Use Power BI to connect to different datasets (tables) and ensure data availability.

Governance: Ensure data complies with regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and set data access rules.

Security: Encrypt sensitive data during collection and ensure proper access controls.

3. Data Preparation
Actions:

Clean data by handling missing values, duplicates, and errors.

Transform data into the appropriate format for analysis (e.g., standardize player IDs, normalize spending data).

Governance: Document data sources and transformations for transparency.

Security: Anonymize PII and ensure data protection standards are followed.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Actions:

Visualize initial data using Power BI (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

Examine data distribution and correlation between key variables (e.g., session time vs. spending).

Governance: Validate data quality and consistency before diving deeper.

Security: Restrict access to sensitive data during the exploration phase.

5. Define Metrics & KPIs
Actions:

Identify key metrics relevant to the business problem (e.g., retention rate, lifetime value, churn).

Ensure KPIs are measurable, consistent, and aligned with business goals.

Governance: Standardize definitions of metrics across teams for consistency.

Security: Ensure metrics do not expose sensitive user information unless necessary.

6. Advanced Analysis & Modeling
Actions:

Apply statistical or machine learning models to analyze the data (e.g., churn prediction, cohort analysis).

Use Power BI's DAX and Power Query to create advanced calculations and insights.

Governance: Ensure models are transparent, reproducible, and documented.

Security: Protect models and sensitive data used in predictions by using role-based access.

7. Data Visualization & Insights Delivery
Actions:

Create interactive Power BI dashboards that clearly communicate insights to stakeholders (e.g., player activity trends, revenue insights).

Use visuals like bar charts, heatmaps, and line graphs to highlight key findings.

Governance: Make sure visualizations are aligned with business needs and provide actionable insights.

Security: Use Power BIâ€™s security features to restrict access to sensitive reports and ensure authorized viewing.

8. Results Interpretation, Feedback & Iteration
Actions:

Present insights and recommendations to stakeholders in clear, actionable terms.

Collect feedback and refine analysis based on stakeholder input.

Governance: Track changes and document all iterations for transparency and consistency.

Security: Regularly review data access permissions and ensure sensitive information is safeguarded.

Data Governance & Security Considerations Across All Steps:
Governance: Maintain data quality standards, document sources and transformations, ensure regulatory compliance, and standardize metric definitions.

Security: Implement encryption for sensitive data, use role-based access control, anonymize personal data where possible, and regularly review access rights to ensure data protection.
